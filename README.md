# BestKabu Browser Extension
A Simple Browser extension that makes Digikabu.de better. This is a Fork of [@ouihq](https://github.com/ouihq/betterKabu)

# Usage

### Chromium: [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bestkabu/okajcjigbfoadcmmhckdpbopohdkhcpg)
### Firefox*: Use the .xpi file in the latest -fire release
**Note:** If you find a relayable way to install the Extension on Firefox on andorid, please let me know. It already should work fine in debugger mode.

**Hint:** On some browsers the Extension shows the link to digikabu.de even if you're on the website. Please check your Privacy settings and Extension permissions.

## Lesson highlighting

## Colorpicker
To change the color of the highlighting: Open the Extension on the digikabu.de website and enter a HEX code in the input field.
